The Tic Tac Toe game in Python is a simple two-player terminal-based game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The program begins by displaying an empty board and prompts Player X to enter the row and column where they want to place their mark. The input is validated to ensure the space is available and within the grid. After each turn, the board is updated and displayed to show the current state of play. The game then checks if the current player has achieved a winning condition—either three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If so, it announces the winner. If the board is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw. This game reinforces basic Python concepts such as lists, loops, conditionals, user input handling, and function use. It provides an engaging way to practice logical thinking and program structure in a fun and interactive format.
